# Rodent-VR
RodentVR is a system developed to assist researchers in performing experiments with lab rats in a virtual reality environment. RodentVR improves upon the current state of the art in this area by providing a system which is easy to use and modify while still allowing for extensive customization of mazes and other parameters. The system is developed in Unreal Engine 4, and interfaces with National Instruments DAQ devices for reward/punishment dispensing. Movement is registered by placing the rodent on top of a large styrofoam ball and placing two computer mice on the sides of the ball to track its rotation. Rodent behavior is tracked during the simulation and is saved in a CSV file. This CSV file can be visualized within RodentVR, or imported into a spreadsheet program for custom analysis.
